# Projects

### [simple-gre-tunnel](https://github.com/63zee/simple-gre-tunnel)  
A simple GRE tunnel. No rules. No overcomplications. Just raw connectivity.

### [ubuntu-shellscripts](https://github.com/63zee/ubuntu-shellscripts)  
Shell scripts (Ubuntu 22.04) that I created quickly for my projects.

### [easyBackup](https://github.com/63zee/easyBackup)  
This script automates the process of creating backups with Restic, cleaning up old backups and uploading backups to the cloud with Rclone. It also sends email notifications to track progress and receive error messages. Ideal for managing regular backups and keeping clean storage.
**(The script and readme of the script is unfortunately in Dutch though, sorry :p)**
