## About Me  

I don't need to introduce myself.  
You either get it, or you don't.  

- **Location**: Somewhere between the cloud and the bare metal.
- **Specialty**: Infrastructure, Automation, Security.
- **Focus**: Keeping systems online. Optimized. Hardened.
- **Mindset**: Performance over clutter. Control over chaos. Function over form.
- **Philosophy**: If it breaks, I already fixed it.
